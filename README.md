# pepino-escape

## Developed by Matias Pierretti during Ironhack Barcelona webdev bootcamp.

This was my first project during the bootcamp, we were given the task to make a game using vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. The result was an avoid-falling-obstacles game made using canvas with a little bit of DOM manipulation for the splash, game, and ending screens. It really helped me put together all the basics learned during the first week.
